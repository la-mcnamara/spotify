# Spotify Repo

In 2022, my family switched from listening on a single Spotify account to having a family account. All four of us used to have the same year-end Spotify wrapped, combining all our listening history, in 2021 and earlier. When we split the accounts, myself, my husband, and my elder all got individual Spotify Wrapped top tracks. Meanwhile my youngest, who was relegated to Spotify Kids, didn't get one at all. The good news for youngest is that mom is a data scientist and can DIY one.

This repo represents functions and analytics related to developing a Spotify Wrapped for my kiddo.
